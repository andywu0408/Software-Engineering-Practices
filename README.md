# Software-Engineering-Practices
The program is a virtualized book keepers program, written in Java, that can keep logs of the book status (ie. borrowed, still on shelf, returned ..etc) for a library.

This is the code I wrote for a software engineering class that I took, where I learned the various software designs, their pro/con/trade-offs, and deciding which one to use for any scenario.

Please feel free to play with it. (hw1/src)

Patterns utilized include Singleton pattern, Observer pattern, and State pattern.

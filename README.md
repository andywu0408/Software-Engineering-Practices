# Software-Engineering-Practices
This is the code I wrote for a software engineering class that I took, where I learned the various software designs, their pro/con/trade-offs, and deciding which one to use for any scenario.

The src/hw1 folder contains java code where I implement some common software engineering design practices, including Singleton pattern, Observer pattern, and State pattern.

The program is a virtualized book keepers that can keep logs of the book status (ie. borrowed, still on shelf, returned ..etc)
